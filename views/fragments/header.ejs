                                across the world, a milestone reached just four months 
                                after it first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
                                More than 51,000 have died and 208,000 recovered in what 
                                has become the biggest global public health crisis of our time.

                                Bitcoin is struggling to hold onto gains following a prolonged 
                                bout of selling, but at least one measure shows that a rally could 
                                be ahead.
                                Based on the DVAN Buying and Selling Pressure Gauge, Bitcoin jumped 
                                above a crucial level of resistance, triggering a positive divergence 
                                and a buy signal. A similar trend played out in January ahead of Bitcoin’s 
                                surge past $10,000.

                                 one cryptocurrency has emerged as the biggest winner in

                                 by 38%, or nearly $2 billion, according to researcher Messari.
